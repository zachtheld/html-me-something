        <h1>Rally in the 100 Acre Woods</h1>
            <p>The 100 Acre Wood Rally is an annual rally racing event held in Salem, Steelville and Potosi Missouri.
            the event is put on by North America's rally organization, Rally America. The race is a two day 
            event where competitors race on real gravel roads across more than 130 miles trying to beat eachothers 
            time in hopes for a podium finish. </p>
            <h3>What is Rally?</h3>
            <p>Rally racing consists of two member teams, a driver and a co-driver. The job of the co-driver is to 
            read the pace notes(turn-by-turn directions)to the driver while he/she navigates the narrow gravel 
            roads at high speeds. The race consists of stages(legs of the race)which are a certian number of miles long.
            The time starts ticking when the team is sent through the start of the stage and stops when they reach the finish.
            In between each stage the team must transit on-road to the next stage. Once all the stages are complete the teams stage times 
            will be added and winners will be declared. </p>
