        <h1>Rally in the 100 Acre Wood</h1>
            <p>The 100 Acre Wood Rally is an annual rally racing event held in Salem, Steelville and Potosi Missouri.
            the event is put on by North America's rally organization, Rally America. The race is a two day 
            event where competitors race on real gravel roads at speeds pushing 90 mph across more than 130 miles trying to beat eachothers 
            time in hopes for a podium finish.</p>
            <br/>
        <h3>What is Rally?</h3>
            <p>Rally racing consists of two member teams, a driver and a co-driver. The job of the co-driver is to 
            read the pace notes(turn-by-turn directions)to the driver while he/she navigates the narrow gravel 
            roads at high speeds. The race consists of stages(legs of the race)which are a certian number of miles long.
            The time starts ticking when the team is sent through the start of the stage and stops when they reach the finish.
            In between each stage the team must transit on-road to the next stage. Once all the stages are complete the team stage times 
            will be added and winners will be declared in different classes. Certian aspects of the car determine what class a car is in. 
            For example whether the car is FWD, RWD, or AWD and the types of modificationss made to those cars.</p>
            <br/>
        <h3>What does a rally car Look Like?</h3>
            <p>Rally cars are not all that different from the cars we see on the street everyday. In fact they have to be street legal to 
            be able to race. The major differences are that the interiors are stripped out of the car, there are no airbags, a rollcage 
            and racing seats with a harness are added for safety, and the car is outfitted with pull-cord fire extinguishers. Other than that
            there is not much else needed to compete in rally besides a good set of rally tires. Obviously when you start upgrading other things 
            such as suspension there is an added advantage, but it is not required to race.</p>
            <br/>
        <h3>Spectating</h3>
            <p>One of the best things about rally is that it is free to watch. You can show up on the day of the event and grab a spectator map, 
            which shows designated viewing spots, and go watch for free. Spectating is a great way to be introduced into the sport, but can get 
            very crowded and sometimes hard to find the ideal spot to watch.</p>
            <br/>
        <h3>Volunteering</h3>
            <p>If you really want the best seat in the house volunteering is the way to get up close to the action. Volunteers help make sure the road is safe for competitors
            and act as crowd control, making sure everyone is viewing the race in a safe manner. Another bonus to being a volunteer is that you get some free merch from the rally!
            To be a volunteer all you need to do is sign up on the event website and the organizers will take care of the rest. They will set you up with team and maps on where you
            need to be and when. Its that easy.</p>
